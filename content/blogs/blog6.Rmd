In this project, I would like to test the difference between the ratings of Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton

```{r}
#First, remake the graph above by filtering the two directors out
Comp_2director <- movies %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) %>% 
  #Then, use summarize to get statistics we need
  summarize(
    mean_rating = round(mean(rating), digits = 2),
    sd_rating = sd(rating),
    count = n(),
    t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
    se = sd_rating/sqrt(count),
    margin_error = t_critical*se,
    lower_ci = mean_rating - margin_error,
    upper_ci = mean_rating + margin_error
  )

#Next, we plot the Confidence Interval with statistics above
ggplot(Comp_2director, aes(x = mean_rating,
                           y = reorder(director, mean_rating),
                           group = director))+
  
        geom_point(aes(color = director), size = 5, show.legend=FALSE) +
         
        #make CI error bars 
        geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = lower_ci, xmax = upper_ci, color = director),
                      width = .1, size = 5, show.legend = FALSE)+
  
        #fill the overlapping part with gray shadow
        geom_rect(aes(xmin = 7.26, 
                xmax = 7.33, 
                ymin = -Inf, 
                ymax = Inf), alpha = 0.1, size = 0)+
  
        
  
        #add titles and labels
        labs(title="Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings?",
        subtitle="95% confidence intervals overlap",
        x="Mean IMDB Rating",
        y="") +
        theme_bw()+

        #adjust position of labels
        geom_text(aes(label = round(lower_ci, 2), x = lower_ci),
            hjust = 0.2,       
            vjust = -2,        
            size  = 7,         
            color = "black") + 
  
  
        geom_text(aes(label = round(upper_ci, 2), x = upper_ci), 
            hjust = 0.2,       
            vjust = -2,        
            size  = 7,         
            color = "black")+ 
  
        geom_text(aes(label = round(mean_rating, 2), x = mean_rating), 
            hjust = 0.2,       
            vjust = -1,      
            size  = 10,         
            color = "black")+   
  
        theme(plot.title=element_text(face="bold",size=20),
              plot.subtitle=element_text(size=15),
              axis.title = element_text(size = 15),
              axis.text.y.left = element_text(size = 15, color = "black"),
              axis.text.x.bottom = element_text(size = 15, color = "black"))


                           


```
##Now, we are doing a hypothesis test 
H0: mean rating of Steven = mean rating of Tim
H1: mean rating of Steven â‰  mean rating of Tim

Conducting a t-test:
```{r}
t_test <- movies %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg"))

#use t.test
t.test(rating ~ director, data = t_test)

```
As we can see above, we yield a t-test with t = 2.7 and a p-value = 0.01. This statistics mean that with our assumption of H0 (the means of the two directors equal), there is a 1% probability that it will happen. Therefore, we can reject H0. 

Now, let's simulate the null distribution as below:
```{r}
#first, get difference in the means
obs_diff <- t_test %>% 
  specify(rating~director) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))


null_distri <- t_test %>% 
  specify(rating ~ director) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%  #generate permutations
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

null_distri %>% 
  visualize +
  theme_bw()+
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "both") #shade the area of p value


```
