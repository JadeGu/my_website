# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


We want to study climate change and find our data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

For this particular data set, NASA clearly states that the base period is the period between 1951-1980.

We run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

First, we selected the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. 

```{r tidyweather1}

weather_1 <- weather %>% 
  select(c(Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec))

glimpse(weather_1)

```


We convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. We named the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather2}

tidyweather <- weather %>% 
  select(1:13) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, names_to = "month", values_to = "delta") 

```


## Plotting Information

We plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and added a trendline. We first needed to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 

```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather1 <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label = TRUE),
         year = year(date))

#plot the graph
ggplot(tidyweather1, aes(x = date, y = delta, color = "#FF6347")) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color = "dark blue")+
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title= "Temperature levels are on the rise",
       subtitle = "Annual temperature deviation relative to 1951-1980 base",
    caption="Source: NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies",
    x = "Years",
    y = "Temperature Deviation"
  )

```

But now we are wondering, is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? We use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line.

```{r facet_wrap}

tidyweather1 <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label = TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather1, aes(x = date, y = delta, colour = "#FF6347"))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="blue") +
  facet_wrap(~month) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature anomalies vary by month", 
    x= "Years",
    y="Temperature Deviation",
    caption="Source: NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies")

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculaltes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We removed data before 1800 using `filter`. Then, we used the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We assigned the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

glimpse(comparison)
```

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Data shows that global warming is real",
    subtitle = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    x     = "Delta",
    y     = "Density"
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we are also interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}


average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta, colour = "#FF6347"))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color = "blue") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  +
  labs (
    title = "Yearly Temperatures Levels have been increasing significantly",
    subtitle= "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    x     = "Years",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         

```

We see that yearly temperature levels have been increasing significantly over the past. Especially in recent years, we have seen a sharp rise in temperature levels.
