CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Data is from https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# file contains 11 variables and 3.66m rows and is well over 380Mb. 
# It will take time to download

# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom::vroom(url)%>% # If vroom::vroom(url) doesn't work, use read_csv(url)
  clean_names()


```

Given the data we have, we produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not

```{r}
remove_items=c("Missing", "Unknown", "Other", NA) #items to remove

death_rate_comord <- covid_data %>% 
  select(sex, age_group, medcond_yn, death_yn) %>% 
  filter(!(sex %in% remove_items),!(age_group %in% remove_items), !(death_yn %in% remove_items) , !(medcond_yn %in% remove_items)) %>% #filter each group by removing items above
  
  #add two columns to quantify if the patient has died or not, and wheter he/she has cormorbidities
  mutate(ifdead = ifelse(death_yn=="Yes", 1, 0), 
         comorbidty= ifelse(medcond_yn=="Yes", "With comorbidities", "Without comorbidities")) %>% 
  
  #group by age, sex and co-morbidities
  group_by(age_group, sex, comorbidty) %>% 
  summarize(deathrate1 = prop(ifdead)) #yield the death rate

#ggplot, facet by comorbidty in row and sex in column
ggplot(death_rate_comord, aes(x=deathrate1, y=age_group)) +
  geom_col(fill="#191970", alpha=0.7) +
  facet_grid(rows= vars(comorbidty), cols= vars(sex))+
  
  #make the graph more visualizable 
  geom_text(aes(label=round(deathrate1*100, 1)),size=2, hjust= -0.1)+
  labs (title = "Covid death % by age group, sex and presence of co-morbidities", x = "Death Rate", y = "Age Group")

```
By age group, the elderly people tend to have a higher covid death rate. By sex, female has a slightly lower covid death rate than male. Additionally, people with comorbidities tend to have higher covid death rate.



2. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.

```{r}
remove_items=c("Missing", "Unknown", "Other", NA) #items to remove

death_rate_icu <- covid_data %>% 
  
  select(sex, age_group, icu_yn, death_yn) %>% 
  
  filter(!(sex %in% remove_items),!(age_group %in% remove_items), !(death_yn %in% remove_items) , !(icu_yn %in% remove_items)) %>% #filter each group by removing items above
  
  #add two columns to quantify if the patient has died or not, and wheter he/she has admitted to ICU
  mutate(ifdead = ifelse(death_yn=="Yes", 1, 0), 
         icu= ifelse(icu_yn=="Yes", "Admitted to ICU", "No ICU")) %>% 
  
  #group by age, sex and ICU
  group_by(age_group, sex, icu) %>% 
  summarize(deathrate2 = prop(ifdead))

#ggplot, facet by ICU in row and sex in column
ggplot(death_rate_icu, aes(x=deathrate2, y=age_group)) +
  geom_col(fill="#FF6347", alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_grid(rows= vars(icu), cols= vars(sex))+
  
  #make the graph more visualizable 
  geom_text(aes(label=round(deathrate2*100, 1)),size=2, hjust= -0.1)+
  labs (title = "Covid death % by age group, sex and whether patient was admitted to ICU", x = "Death Rate", y = "Age Group")

```

By age group, the elderly people tend to have a higher covid death rate. By sex, female has a slightly lower covid death rate than male in almost every age group. Additionally, people who were admitted to ICU tend to have higher covid death rate.
